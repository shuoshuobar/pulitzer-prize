# The Pulitzer Chronicle

## Goal:
Analyze and visualize news organizations winning the Pulitzer Prize in international reporting.

## Findings:
1. The Pulitzer Prize for international reporting often mirrors global crises.
2. The New York Times takes home the most Pulitzer Prize in international reporting, followed by The Washington Post and The Associated Press. 

## Process of Data Collection:
Scraped the international reporting section of the Pulitzer Prize: https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-category/210.
   
## Process of Data Analysis:
1. Accessed the winners' table, extracting year, news organization(s) winning the Pulitzer Prize in international reporting and the following reporting description
2. Ranked by count the number of times news organizations won the prize in international reporting
3. Created a word cloud, using font size to indicate the frequency of international reporting awards from 1948 to 2024

## Skills/Approaches in Use:
1. Playwright - Web-scraping
2. Python - Pandas: data organizing 
3. Excel - minor dataset tweaks
4. Python - Word Cloud making
5. Illustrator: Responsive graph editing and exporting with ai2html
6. HTML: Webpage design

## Limitation/Looking Ahead:
1. I have tried hard using ggpattern with an image of a book stack but had a hard time fitting the often distorted image outlook.
2. Had I know how to use Illustrator, a pictogram of small book icons could be an interesting visualization.
